History Will Repeat Itself: A Bear Scenario that Will Likely Happen ,1174,1hgqaex,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hgqaex/history_will_repeat_itself_a_bear_scenario_that/,1734484907.0,822,"This is long so if you don’t want to or simply can’t read, just type a stock WSB response like “hurr durr stonks only go up” and move on.  If you have actual thoughts on what I’m saying or think I’m wrong, please share.  

To begin, we need to talk about what happened in 2018.  The market and Trump’s first administration were running smoothly.  Stonks only went up.  Then in 2018, they didn’t.  Why?  A few factors.  First, Trump introduced tariffs on aluminum, steel, and other goods to try to make American companies a more viable alternative to China(sound familiar?).   This essentially created a trade war with China, and led to China showing much slower economic growth than expected.  This led to a 500 point drop in the Dow on global recession fears.  

Later in the year, a newly appointed(by Trump) chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, had a conference in December.  By that point, the Fed had already hiked interest rates 4 times that year.  Powell stated at that conference that the Fed would likely slow rate hikes in 2019, but the market did not buy that and fears of a recession set in.  The Dow dropped 350 points soon after.  Trump made remarks about firing Powell after this debacle, but backed off.  There were other factors at play, such as the Schiller PE being 33.31(it is currently at 38.55), but those two factors were likely the biggest.  

One more important point:  Trump is obsessed with the stock market.  My favorite story on this topic comes from the Covid era.  On Friday, March 13,  Trump brought the CEO’s from a bunch of big players to the White House for a press conference.  He basically paraded them around, lauding how everything is going to be ok and Tim Apple is going to save us.  During this Friday afternoon circus, SPY ripped from 250 to 270 in an hour.  That night, Trump sent a signed copy of the chart from that day to Lou Dobbs to brag.   Then on the following Monday, we had another circuit breaker day as SPY tanked 11%.  

I tell you all this because history is going to repeat itself.  Trump has already touted 100% tariffs on fucking everything.  Whether he follows through with them, who knows.  He could just be using them as a threat to get leverage on trade deals.  But he has a precedent of using them, so I believe he will follow through.  His goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, which is all well and good.  Jobs are good.  But one thing about manufacturing here as opposed to, say, India, is we aren’t going to be ok with being paid $1.38 a day.  The cost in labor to produce here is not nearly as appealing as producing in Vietnam, Bangladesh, or any other country that uses what is essentially slave labor with zero worker protections and zero environmental regulations.  Additionally, it will take years for any company that does choose to manufacture here to get up and running, and who knows what the political environment will look like once Trump is gone.  

We are also set up for another war between Trump and Powell.  This one WILL 100% happen.  Although it came in as expected, the last CPI showed inflation increasing slightly after months of continuous decline.  The PPI, however, came in hotter than expected.  This is a huge problem.  The Fed will for sure cut tomorrow, and Powell will give his speech on using his tools and data and taking in information as it comes, but I promise you this cut is concerning for him.  They want that 2% target, and Trump’s hot economy is not going to let them get there.  The combination of Trump cutting every regulation and allowing companies to shit in our water supply, along with his 100% tariffs on some imports, WILL BRING INFLATION BACK.  If companies have to pay more to import the goods that they sell, they will pass those costs onto the consumer.  There is no other way about it.  I know his goal is to bring manufacturing back, but that will take a lot of time.  And in the meantime, equities will suffer as inflation rises, and the Fed is forced to embarrassingly increase rates again.  

What I’m interested to see is how the battle of Trump vs Powell plays out.  There have already been a few articles regarding Trump possibly firing Powell, to which he responded “I don’t think so”, but he’s a liar so I don’t believe that.  Trump simply wants to be surrounded by yes men.  That is why he had the highest turnover of any administration in US history.  Honestly I think it just gets his dick hard to fire people, especially given “you’re fired” was his trademark phrase from that stupid tv show.  Powell has said it is illegal for Trump to do so, and that he is not leaving under any circumstances.  Personally I think he hates Trump, and rightfully so.  

So this is my prediction.  Trump gets into office, and on day one announces regulation cuts and tariffs.  He gives tax breaks to companies that choose to bring jobs to the US, and so on.  He wants economic growth at any cost.  Markets react mixed because the tariffs are concerning.  We start to see inflation rise due to importing costs rising.  Then Powell and the Fed fight over raising rates to tame inflation, because higher rates = slower growth.  Where we go from there, I’m not sure.  If Trump does try to fire Powell and succeeds,  I think that will be an extremely concerning look.  Powell has done a fairly decent job of getting things under control, and has done a very good job of telegraphing the Fed’s next moves.  The market hates uncertainty, and he knows that.  Trump firing him and installing a yes man will be extremely detrimental imo.  

So what do you think?  Will history repeat itself? ",0.0,A

Quick math using the study he cited and data from Google gives us:

32% of 386M US subscribers currently paying an average $141/Month each = 123M people willing to pay $7.50 per month for satellite D2D. 50/50 revenue share with mobile operators leaves 123M x $3.75 = $461M/Month in revenue up for grabs. That's just the US.

"Self-driving business grows 6x, Uber is clearly misplaced by the market and is on the verge of 50% upside",19,1hh99le,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hh99le/selfdriving_business_grows_6x_uber_is_clearly/,1734549451.0,33,"Shares of Uber ( NYSE: UBER ) have fallen more than 30% from their October 2024 highs in just a few weeks on concerns that self-driving cars could eliminate intermediary services:

https://preview.redd.it/ncqr7mkton7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5be5fc6a2808eb552fe5efa419afcff986c0b184

While news such as Google's Waymo skipping Uber to enter the self-driving cab business in Miami is thought-provoking enough to make some investors uneasy, Uber's positioning as the “transportation app for everyone” - an aggregator of all transportation needs for more than 160 million consumers - makes it an inevitable market platform for self-driving car companies. This makes it an inevitable market platform for self-driving car companies. Tesla and Google have deep pockets, but building a bilateral network of self-driving cabs from scratch would cost (and burn) tens of billions of dollars, take years to achieve scalable economics, and make it difficult to change customer behavior - despite the novelty of driverless cabs. Additionally, Uber has partnered with several AV providers to bring self-driving cabs to its platform:

https://preview.redd.it/i0vyye8yon7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f17b6075787a9b0dc4af67c37e0ebe7b6c46100c

From an economic standpoint, it makes more sense to partner with Uber as an AV supplier than to try to create demand on a new network of self-driving cabs with a limited and expensive AV fleet.



Now, in the past, Uber's leadership team has used self-driving cars as TAM extenders, which is the right thought process, as increased supply in the form of robo-taxis could potentially lower Uber's cost-per-mile, which in turn would push penetration and total bookings higher!

The growth of the self-driving car market will unfold over the next decade or two, so it seems premature to abandon Uber based on concerns about disintermediation. As long as Uber's business grows as planned, there's no reason to panic sell. On the contrary, Uber stock's recent decline has significantly improved its long-term risk/reward, with TQI's five-year expected compound annual growth rate for Uber jumping from \~16.1% to \~25.8%.



Based on forward-looking estimates, Uber's revenue will continue to grow at a healthy double-digit rate over the next five years:

As a result, in today's valuation, the analysts are sticking with the growth and margin assumptions used in their previous assessment of Uber. That is, updating Uber's revenue base to $43.71 billion (2024 consensus revenue estimate) and updating the stock count to 2.154 billion shares. All other assumptions remain unchanged and relatively simple.

Based on the valuation model, Uber's fair value is approximately $105.50 per share, or currently undervalued by approximately 45%. In addition, given the sharp decline, Uber's long-term risk/reward has improved considerably. Given its 5-year expected compound annual growth rate is currently about 25.8% - well above our 15% investment threshold rate.



In a historically expensive stock market, Uber is now one of the few large tech stocks that offer amazing value!

Uber is making every effort to become a reliable money-printing machine. Given Uber's fast-growing cash flow production and the shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies adopted by management, investors had plenty of margin of safety in this large tech stock.



Now, Uber stock is finally pulling back. Yes, Uber's image has been poor due to recent self-driving cab developments; however, Uber's business is in good shape with continued strong sales and profitability growth:

https://preview.redd.it/h06e8jinpn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba2cf41a6dc09ec5267d660fe0b4693a62526151

In Q3 2024, Uber's total bookings increased 16% year-over-year to $40.97 billion, driven by healthy growth in MAPC \[up 13% year-over-year\] and MAPC usage frequency \[up 4% year-over-year\]. Additionally, Uber's cash conversion continued to improve at a rapid pace in Q3, with free cash flow increasing +133% year-over-year to $2.1 billion.

From a technical perspective, Uber shares are above the 100-week moving average, which could be strong support. Additionally, the 200-week moving average is at $47. Given that Uber's weekly RSI is near oversold territory, the $47-$57 range is a strong buy zone for long-term investors.

It was a den of degenerate high risk gamblers who adequately self-moderated their community with extreme toxicity.  If someone asked an innocent question, responses of hope you lose everything, that you will fuck their wife, or they are going to be sucking dick behind Wendy's for three fiddy a pop should always be appropriate behavior here.  Quite simply, If people cannot stomach this kind of toxicity, how would they be able to stomach the real world consequences of losing a couple million dollars in an hour, losing their house, or actually losing their spouse because of degenerate behavior.  Being inclusive or nice to people in this community actually makes the world a shittier place as it normalizes extremely high risk behavior that should not be for everyone.  I accordingly want to tell each of you to go fuck yourselves and I hope you can provide me with the level of toxicity that matches or exceeds this in return - I want your worst.       

I like Black Swan's and this post represents DD for such an investment.  Ultimately I am posting this here because I really want someone to prove my investment thesis wrong - PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG.  The math is so extremely simple that I am going to present my thesis mostly with meme's because I believe that the financial apocalypse should be something light hearted and filled with humor.  This is DD accordingly is for the collapse of the global financial system and if I am correct that will make 2 for 2 on calling black swans on wsb (so much better then Burry who has predicted 450 of the last 2 crashes).  Technically everything collapsed back in September 2019 and has been held together with tape and bits of string, but nobody really wants to identify the problem and I have no problem telling the truth so here we go.   

1)  Interest.  The Federal Reserve pays currently pays banks an annual interest rate of 4.65% on Bank Reserves.

https://preview.redd.it/6a48nsdepg7e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e42cb98758b46e68c1b39b11320cb9fc468f45

2) Principal.  Banks currently have $3,211,700,000,000 ($3.2 Trillion) in Bank Reserves help with the Federal Reserve.  Bank Reserves only exists in such high amounts as a balancing entry for the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing (QE) programs - when people joke about the Federal Reserve printing money they are referencing the process of creating Bank Reserves out of thin air.  QE was used to support the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis, COVID, or simply when wall street was lazy and didn't want to work (the ""Taper Tantrum""); the Federal Reserve creates ""Bank Reserves"" to purchase ""toxic assets"" from Bank's to stimulate the economy.

3) The Federal Reserve is currently paying $149 Billion in interest on Bank Reserves (Interest rate in item 1 multiplied by the total deposits in item 2).  The Bank's dragged their feet and didn't absorb the toxic assets previously sold to the Federal Reserve back onto their balance sheets quick enough (these are truly garbage assets so why would you want to buy them back?).   When a rate hiking cycle was required to combat inflationary pressures, Central Banks around the world labelled inflation as ""transitory"" as hiking rates illuminates the massive problem with QE if it wasn't unwound.  It's a game of chicken right now, the Bank's are being rewarded by being paid interest on historical bailouts (they are keeping their mouths shut), the Central Banks (including the Fed) are insolvent and are hoping they can find a way out still (they are silent), and Governments are starting to collapse around the world.  

https://preview.redd.it/b8t984cipg7e1.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a957926f269e3d206cd1ce1ea5855547fd50cf

4) The financial system is being propped up with an hidden bailout.  The Bank's don't have enough liquidity to pull the toxic assets back onto their balance sheets or to repay the interest that rightfully belongs to taxpayers.  As the Bank's, Central Banks, and the Government's are all hiding this problem from the world, how can taxpayers support another bailout to an industry that refused to fix its own problems.  As per FDIC cumulative Trailing-Twelve-Month Net Income for the 4,517 commercial banks and savings institutions is $236.9 Billion and the majority of these earnings are attributed to interest paid by the fed.  This bailout (Fed Interest) isn't even fairly paid out (concentrated to the largest banks/prime brokerages) and we are about to enter a race to the bottom.  ""Are you there Jamie Dimon? It's Me, God""

Why is APLD so under the radar?,26,1hh5op8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hh5op8/why_is_apld_so_under_the_radar/,1734540226.0,24,"A little while back NVDA announced a ~3% stake in Applied Digital (APLD) causing the stock to soar for a short while before dropping back under everyone's radar. I can't find anyone talking about it hardly anywhere, nor even on their own sub.

I think it's staggering considering they are company positioned right on the cusp of being massively influential in the data center space, and (according the sentiment from the institutions/analysts that I can find) will possibly report a positive EPS by 2026 or even 2025 if they have an above average year. 

As of yesterday they announced the energization of their new Ellendale facility with a capacity for 100MW  and are building a 400MW data center with rumored deals of a tenant that has a projected low end revenue of 1B a year for 10-15 years. 

Further, they have monopolized 18% of North Dakota's entire energy output with future deals and current facilities. North Dakota has the cheapest energy in the U.S. and many other data center companies have been scrambling to secure their own portion of the power production. 

In my opinion™, the upside on this stock far and away outweighs the potential loss with the average price target right now at ~$11.14 and the high target being $13+ from some analysts all the way up to $16 (although I think that's slightly unrealistic at this time)

The barrier to entry of this stock is low, the buy signaling is high, the price has resistance at ~$10 but I can't help but this this is going to pop off come next year. Call me crazy but that's what I see. 

What are yall's opinions?

Just survive until ’25, they told themselves. By then, inflation would be whipped, money would be cheaper, and demand would again tilt in their favor. But the wished-for salvation was wishful thinking. Borrowing costs remain stubbornly high, and lenders are running low on patience. As the new year approaches, the industry is bracing for the losses it’s been putting off. “I look at 2025 as a year of reckoning,” says Tim Mooney, head of real estate at Värde Partners, which invests in property debt. “Lenders and borrowers will acknowledge that lower interest rates aren’t going to save them.”

2. YouTube = Tendies from all ages: It’s monetizing both the Boomers and Gen Z eyeballs milking them for every cent.

3. Cloud Revenue 🚀 : Google Cloud is up **30%** YoY. They’re catching up to AWS and Azure like a freight train and THERE IS NO SAFE WORD!

4. Weymo, Tokyo, up-go, y’know?

5. It’s Not Even Overpriced (Yet): PE ~26. If you’re still crying that “Big Tech is expensive,” literally just shut the fuck up.

GOOG is a low-risk, high-reward tendie train for monkés who want to stop seeing ~~RED~~ their wife getting trained on the weekends.

**TSLA - The big-Brain Hedge You are still too Dumb to Consider**

Tesla is the most overvalued clown car on the market. It looks like shit, it’s priced like shit and the groupies make it sound like Musk just invented teleportation, cured baldness, and colonized Mars simultaneously. **Spoiler Alert! >!He didn’t!<.**

1. When the Market loses hype momentum, TSLA Gets Nuked ☠️ . Overvalued growth names like Tesla get slapped like a hookers cheeks behind Wendy’s, especially if JPow pulls the wrong face.

2. Buying OTM put spreads is a small cost to hedge your brainless GOOG upside. If TSLA drops 20%, you’re eating so many tendies you’ll need a stairmaster to get to bed.

**TLDR** **GOOG Calls** Buy it, hold it, shut up. It’s free money. **TSLA Put Spreads** Buy a cheap put spread. If the market slips, TSLA dumps, and you get paid.

If the market moons, GOOG wins. If the market dies, TSLA pays for your next YOLO. Either way, you’re not left high and dry like the rest of the regards here.

Don’t fumble this you fucking idiot.

With everything crushing all-time-highs, I've been looking for a stock to buy some 3 month calls on, and settled on Target. Here is why I made the decision:

**Expert's Analysis** - People that know way more than me have an average target price at $160.57 at MarketBeat.
Recent drop creating value: Target missed EPS by 19.56% in November, causing the stock to drop over 20% - from 156 to 121. It has since rallied slightly, but still only has a P/E ratio of 14.27 which is well below Walmart's 38.92.

**Brand Strength** - Target has a strong brand identity with loyal customer demographics, particularly among millennials and suburban families a/k/a white girls love target.

**Dividend History** - Target has a strong history of dividend payouts. The stock is listed as a ""dividend king"" which is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 51 years. This means that it's not just the degens buying the stock up.

**Holiday Season Outperforming Expectations** - Since buying, a recent article just said the following: ""Evercore ISI initiated a positive tactical trade call on Target (TGT) and adding the stock to the firm’s “Tactical Outperform” list, reflecting rising shopping intentions for holiday from the firm’s latest survey as well as a positive inflection of web traffic from a negative low single digit trend to a positive mid-teen increase in December-to-date.""

**Soft Landing** - There was a lot of financial uncertainty in 2024. But, it looks like we're pulling off a soft landing so people are becoming less worried about spending which means people will flock back to Target as a ""not expensive but slightly more expensive/nicer than Walmart"" brand. 

This is not financial advice, just my opinion based on what the experts are saying. 

Here is the position:

**Position:** https://imgur.com/a/oGBYFiB.  I thought it was good value when I bought it which means it's even better value right now. My position spiked up to being even earlier when the stock jumped to 3%, but, I held as I think it has room to run over the next few weeks.",0.6486,$TGT
