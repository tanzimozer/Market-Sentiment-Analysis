# Market-Sentiment-Analysis
Stock Sentiment Analysis Using News and Social Media

Summary
The Market-Sentiment-Analysis project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze how sentiment influences stock price movements. Rather than pre-selecting stocks, this project uses real-time sentiment data from social media and financial news to dynamically identify trending stocks. By combining sentiment trends with historical stock prices, it builds predictive models to forecast price changes, providing actionable insights for traders and investors.
This project highlights cutting-edge data science skills, including data scraping, NLP, time-series analysis, and predictive modeling, to showcase how public sentiment drives financial markets.

Project Goals
Dynamically identify trending stocks based on real-time sentiment analysis.
Collect and analyze sentiment data from financial news and social media platforms.
Correlate sentiment trends with historical stock price movements.
Build predictive models to forecast stock price changes based on sentiment analysis.
Visualize insights using interactive plots and dashboards.

Dynamic Stock Selection Process
To avoid preselection bias and ensure relevance to current market conditions, this project uses a dynamic stock selection framework:

Trending Stocks Detection:

Scrape social media (Twitter, Reddit) and financial news to track frequently mentioned tickers.
Use NLP to score sentiment for each ticker and calculate sentiment volatility.
Sentiment-Based Ranking:

Rank stocks by sentiment activity (e.g., volume of mentions, positive/negative shifts).
Select the top N trending stocks dynamically (e.g., top 5-10).
Filtering Criteria:

Include only stocks with high trading volume or relevance (e.g., S&P 500, mid-cap to large-cap).
This ensures the analysis focuses on market-driven stocks, aligning the project with real-world trading scenarios.

Data Sources
Financial News:

Sources: Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, MarketWatch.
Tools: APIs (e.g., NewsAPI) or web scraping (BeautifulSoup).
Social Media:

Twitter: Tweets containing stock-related keywords and hashtags (e.g., $TSLA, $AAPL).
Reddit: Posts from communities like r/wallstreetbets using Pushshift API.
Stock Data:

Historical stock prices for selected tickers from Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).

Tools and Libraries
Data Collection: BeautifulSoup, Tweepy, Pushshift API, requests.
NLP Processing: VADER, TextBlob, Hugging Face Transformers (BERT).
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Regression, Random Forest), TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM).
Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau/Power BI.

Methodology
Phase 1: Dynamic Stock Selection
Scrape and Analyze Sentiment Data:

Collect real-time mentions of stock tickers from Twitter, Reddit, and news platforms.
Use NLP to assign sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) for each mention.
Rank Trending Stocks:

Calculate a Sentiment Volatility Index to rank stocks based on sentiment shifts.
Select the top N stocks with significant sentiment-driven activity.

Phase 2: Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Remove special characters, stop words, and perform tokenization.
Sentiment Scoring: Assign sentiment categories and scores using NLP tools like VADER or TextBlob.
Data Merging: Merge sentiment scores with historical stock price data.

Phase 3: Sentiment Analysis and Visualization
Analyze Correlations: Identify patterns between sentiment scores and stock price movements.
Visualize Findings:
Sentiment trends vs. stock prices.
Peaks in sentiment aligning with major stock price movements.

Phase 4: Predictive Modeling
Train Predictive Models:
Build ML/DL models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM) to predict stock price changes based on sentiment.
Evaluate Performance:
Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Accuracy.

Phase 5: Insights and Findings
Highlight which stocks are most influenced by sentiment.
Provide actionable insights for traders and investors based on predictions.

Key Results
Dynamic stock selection ensures analysis reflects real-world market sentiment.
Clear patterns and correlations between sentiment scores and stock price trends.
A predictive model capable of forecasting stock price movements based on sentiment analysis.
Interactive visualizations for sentiment trends and stock prices.
Learning Outcomes
NLP Techniques: Sentiment scoring, tokenization, and BERT-based models.
Dynamic Stock Selection: Identifying and ranking stocks based on real-time sentiment.
Machine Learning: Building and evaluating predictive models for financial applications.
Visualization: Crafting insightful dashboards to present actionable data.
